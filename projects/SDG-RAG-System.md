# SDG RAG System

This project is a practice in creating and understanding the mechanisms of a RAG Systems. This RAG has been specialised in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including its targets, indicators, progress, and history. 

Given that SDG is a dense topic that is continuously being worked and improved on, this RAG system could be useful for anyone wanting to: 
- Quickly gain an understanding of what the SDGs are and their targets and indicators;
- Or, obtian accurate and up-to-date information on any of the SDGs and their progress over the years.
